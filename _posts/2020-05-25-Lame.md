This is a very easy machine from HackTheBox and this is also my first writeup.
The ip-address of the box at this moment is 10.10.10.3.

## [](#header-2)Enumeration

Staring enumeration with nmap.

```
nmap -A 10.10.10.3 > nmap.txt
```
![](Pictures/Lame/nmap.png)

Four port are open, 21, 22, 139 and 445.

Lets take a closer look at FTP and Samba.
FTP allows anonymous login but there is no files inside.
The version of the ftp client is vsFTPd, which is a version with a built in backdoor.
A quick search in searchsploit gives the following result:
```
searchsploit vsftpd
```
![](Pictures/Lame/searchsploit1.png)
vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor command execution (Metasploit) - might be of interest.
A search for Samba 3.0.20 gives the following:

```
searchsploit samba 3.0.20
```

Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution (Metasploit) - might be of interest.

## [](#header-2)Exploitation



So lets fire up metasploit and try this two exploits out.
### [](#header-3)vsFTPd - Metasploit

This didnt work, maybe there is a solution to get this to work, but instead, lets take a look at the other exploit instead.





### [](#header-3)Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution - Metasploit

![](Pictures/Lame/meta2.png)

This exploit works better and we got a shell. Whoami show me that i am the root user. With the root-account from the start we can get the user.txt flag and the root.txt flag without any privesc from any of the user-accounts.


### [](#header-3)Video
I recorded a video to show this below.
