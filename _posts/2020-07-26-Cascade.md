title: Writeup - HackTheBox - Cascade
published: true
---

This is a Windows machine from HackTheBox and its categorized as
“medium” difficulty.
The machine is a Domain Controller with a lot of user accounts. I
stared with enumeration of Ldap and SMB. Ldap gave me some user
names and one password. SMB got me further with that users account
and led me to some interesting files. I did some reverse
engineering on and finally got another password. I was able to log
in with WinRM and was managed to get the password from an old
deleted admin account. That password was the same as the
Administrator. I was now able to login as Administrator.

## [](#header-2)Enumeration

### [](#header-3)Nmap
I started with an nmap scan to get a list of running services on
the machine.
```
nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oA nmap/nmap 10.10.10.182
```
![](Pictures/Cascade/nmap1.png)

The machine had some ports open and I was able to see the domain
name, cascade.local. I put this into the hosts file (/etc/hosts).

### [](#header-3)Ldapsearch
I did some further enumeration with ldapsearch to see if I could
get some useful information from the domain controller.
```
ldapsearch -x -h 10.10.10.182 -s sub -b 'dc=cascade,dc=local' >
ldapsearch.txt
```
The information I got back was massive. I had to read everything
manually. I found a lot of users and I also found a base64 string
that might be of interest.

![](Pictures/Cascade/ldap1.png)
```
cascadeLegacyPwd: clk0bjVldmE=
```
This is base64 encoded. I decoded with the following command:
```
echo clk0bjVldmE= | base64 -d
```
The result was: rY4n5eva. At this moment I had a user, r.thompson
and a legacy password, rY4n5eva.

### [](#header-3)SMB enumeration with Metasploit
I tried to do some enumeration with this user with Metasploit SMB
Enumeration.

![](Pictures/Cascade/meta1.png)
The credentials was working and I got information back where a
list of shares was presented to me.
My next step was to try to log in to everyone of them to try to
find more information.
I ran the following command on every share:
```
smbclient -U r.thompson //10.10.10.182/<NAME OF SHARE>
```
and the shares that i could access is the following:
```
Data
NETLOGON
print$
SYSVOL
```
Now I wanted to get all the files that I could access from all
shares, so i mounted the shares, one by one, like this.
```
sudo mount.cifs //10.10.10.182/<NAME OF SHARE> -o
username=r.thompson /mnt/temp/
```
```
mkdir SMB
```
```
cd SMB
```
```
mkdir <NAME OF SHARE>
```
```
cd <NAME OF SHARE>
```
```
rsync -r --progress /mnt/temp/* .
```
```
sudo umount -a
```
By doing like this I try to copy the full structure of the SMB
share to my local computer. In this way it would be easier for me
to look at the data.
I now have the following directories.
![](Pictures/Cascade/mount1.png)

To make a quick overview of all the files i did the following:

```
ls -laR
```
### [](#header-3)Interesting files from SMB
This will show all the files in all the directories. There is a
lot of sub-folders. Will only show the files that is important.

With all this files I started to read them on by one. Some of the
information I found to be more of interest at this point is the
following:

<p>For anyone that missed yesterday�s meeting (I�m looking at
you Ben). Main points are below:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p>-- New production network will be going live on
Wednesday so keep an eye out for any issues. </p>
<p>-- We will be using a temporary account to
perform all tasks related to the network migration and this account will be
deleted at the end of
2018 once the migration is complete. This will allow us to identify actions
related to the migration in security logs etc. Username is TempAdmin (password
is the same as the normal admin account password). </p>
<p>-- The winner of the �Best GPO� competition will be
announced on Friday so get your submissions in soon.</p>

```
In this note I saw that an account, TempAdmin, has been active on
the system before, maybe its still active, maybe not. The password
for this account has been the same as the normal Administrator
account. Judging by the name of the account it is an Admin account
aswell. This is very interesting.

In this file it seems that two accounts has been deleted and put
in the AD recycle bin: TempAdmin and Test.

I can see that there is a password line, what seems to be in HEX.
I tried to decode it in a hexviewer but it didn’t work.

### [](#header-3)Converting the HEX-password
After some googling I found a tool to convert the hexcode from the
TightVNC registry file. A <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/crack-or-decrypt-vnc-server-encrypted-password/">website</a> was linking to an online aswell
as a Windows tool. I downloaded the tool for Windows.
With this tool I managed to convert the hash in a more correct
way.

![](Pictures/Cascade/vnccrack.png)

Now I got another password, sT333ve2, but I didn’t have a username
to try it with.
It was time for some more enumeration.

### [](#header-3)Rpcclient
I used rpcclient to try to get usernames. I tried to login without
any credentials, and that worked.
```
rpcclient -U '' 10.10.10.182
```
![](Pictures/Cascade/rpcclient1.png)
The command enumdomusers gave me some usernames. I saved them all
in a text file, user.txt.
![](Pictures/Cascade/usernames1.png)
Now I wanted to try this password with all users on the SMB.

### [](#header-3)SMB user enumeration with Metasploit
Back in Metasploit I ran the following:
![](Pictures/Cascade/meta2.png)

The user s.smith is also allowed to access the SMB, maybe have
some more access then r.thompson?

### [](#header-3)More Interesting files from SMB
I tried to connect to Audit$ with s.smith because i couldn’t reach
it before, and it worked!
![](Pictures/Cascade/smb1.png)
Just like before I mounted the share in the same way and made a
copy of all data.
```
sudo mount.cifs //10.10.10.182/Audit$ -o username=s.smith /mnt/temp/
```
I stared looking at the files with different tools but I didn’t
really found anything, so I copied all files on to a windows
machine.

### [](#header-3)Decompiling EXE and DLL files
Here I tried to look at them in a decomplier.
![](Pictures/Cascade/decomp1.png)
I found this string of data, called the IV: 1tdyjCbY1Ix49842. The
database file in the DB folder contained a password:
BQO5l5Kj9MdErXx6Q6AGOw==. In the .exe file I found the string str:
c4scadek3y654321.
![](Pictures/Cascade/decomp2.png)
With the IV together with the string from the exe file I should
get the encrypted password from the DB-file?

I did some googling and found an online <a href="https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption">tool</a>.
![](Pictures/Cascade/decrypt1.png)
From that I got this: dzNsYzBtZUZyMzFuZA== its base64 encoded.
```
echo dzNsYzBtZUZyMzFuZA== | base64 -d
```
And the result was: w3lc0meFr31nd
So this might be the password for some of the users.

### [](#header-3)WinRM/SMB enumeration with Metasploit
Next I tried to see if there is any users that could log in with
WinRM. I put all the passwords i got so far into a file, pass.txt.

![](Pictures/Cascade/pass-file1.png)
I tried Metasploit smb_login again with this results.

![](Pictures/Cascade/meta3.png)
The user arksvc is able to login to SMB. Next up I tried to see if
any of the users is able to log in with winrm.
![](Pictures/Cascade/meta4.png)

## [](#header-2)Exploitation
### [](#header-3)Evil-WinRM
I can see that arksvc is able to login with winrm, so lets try
that with Evil-Winrm.
```
evil-winrm -u arksvc -p w3lc0meFr31nd -i 10.10.10.182
```
![](Pictures/Cascade/evil1.png)
At this point I remember from earlier in the enumeration that two
users where deleted, where TempAdmin maybe is the most
interesting.
I tried to dig something out from that user. The user might not
really be deleted but put as a tombstone, awaiting complete
deletion from the domain. The default time for this to happen is
between 60 - 180 days depending of Windows settings by default, if
not changed.
I was working with this for a very long time but then I got the
syntax correct:
```
Get-ADObject -Filter * -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties *
```
That gave me a lot of data back. But scrolling from the bottom a
bit up. got me this:

![](Pictures/Cascade/dump1.png)

This is also base64 encoded. Decoded it looks like this:
baCT3r1aN00dles

### [](#header-3)Administrator access
The note from earlier said that TempAdmin should have the same
password as the Administrator, so lets try Evil-WinRM again with
Administrator.
```
evil-winrm -u Administrator -p baCT3r1aN00dles -i 10.10.10.182
```
![](Pictures/Cascade/admin.png)
Now I got the Administrator account and I should be albe to get
both flags.
