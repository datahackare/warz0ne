Im just a Swedish guy that try to learn more about pentesting.
This site is a way for me to save things online so i can go back to look at them if i need to. Im mostly doing CTF's on HackTheBox.

I have been working with digital foreniscs for the past 6 years, but i have not so much experience with pentesting, so please feel free to correct me if i explain anything in a strange och wrong way. Im just trying to learn here.
