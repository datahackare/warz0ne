Im just a Swedish guy trying to learn more about pentesting.
This site is a way for me to save things online so I can go back to look at them later. Im mostly doing CTF's on HackTheBox (<a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/44591">profile</a>).

I have been working with digital forensics for the past 6 years, but I have not so much experience with pentesting. So please feel free to correct me if I explain anything in a strange/wrong way. 
Im just trying to learn here... ;)
